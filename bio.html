		<p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;">
		My name is Andrew Pierson, and I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama where I graduated from Hoover High School. I am currently a Senior at the University of North Alabama studying Computer Science 
		and minoring in Cybersecurity. While in college, I have worked at a town-favorite restaurant, The Shoals Shack.
		
		My girlfirend of 3 years, Emma Melton, 
		works in children's behavioral therapy and enrolled in graduate school at the University of Alabama-Huntsvile. 

		<br><br>
		Outside of work or school, I spend my free time playing tennis. At the University of North Alabama, I started the Club Tennis program, where we organize travel to other 
		Universities to compete in tournaments.
		I enjoy playing tennis because competition is thrilling and this sport keeps me active.
